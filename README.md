This is the source code for the site [https://iotwx.github.io](https://iotwx.github.io).  It uses the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## BUILDING THE SITE

To build the site follow the following steps:

1. download and install the latest version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing);

2. clone the master branch of [this repository](https://github.com/iotwx/iotwx.github.io-hugo.git);

3. from the root of the repository run `hugo` from the command line which will generate the site and put the static files in the the folder called `public`.  You will need to check the site to make sure you did not break anything;  

4. check in the site all of the site the content lives in `content`;

5. please read the `Hugo` docs to learn about [content management in Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/).  Have fun!

## ADDING CONTENT

1. after you have read some of the docs on content management (step 5 above), make a new branch, build your site locally and submit a pull request when ready -- we welcome contrubutions of all kinds.
