Real-time sensors are increasingly being used for scientific analysis and discovery in earth science education. The Internet of Things (IoT) concept describes an environment in which small, inexpensive sensors become ubiquitous and stream their data to servers on the Internet in real-time. Recently, a platform called the IoTwx has been developed to expand, explore and bring visibility to low cost, IoT weather sensing. Initially designed and developed at UCAR/COMET in 2014, 3D printed Automated Weather station (3D-PAWS) is a Raspberry Pi based weather station composed of nearly 70% 3d-printed parts. It has been deployed into dozens of locations around the globe and has recently undergone a series of proposed modifications to improve its deployability and simplify its construction for researchers looking for low-cost, durable, and easy-to-deploy weather stations.

Therefore, at the heart of this project is the advancement of tools and capacity to explore building mesonets atop these low-cost sensors.  Indeed, dense mesonets to support operational forecasting, research, emergency management, and educational outreach are rare, and remarkably, only three US states (Oklahoma, New York, and most recently Texas) have such mesonets. The high costs of building and maintaining the requisite network of weather stations (often between $10,000 - $15,000 per commercial grade system) are the primary factor cited in the slow development of these mesonets, yet their value in improving operational outcomes are obvious. 

This project provides a support platform for researchers to collaborate on IoT based instrumentation, expeditions, field programs as well as research and data services needed to advance the scientific understanding of the Earth system. 

To address the IoT as it could be applied to the geosciences, an NSF-funded project called “Cloud-Hosted Real-time Data Services for the Geosciences” (CHORDS, see chordsrt.com) was proposed and funded in 2016 to explore the use of real-time data in a scientific context. We will us CHORDS to store and stream the data real-time produced by our 3D printed stations.
