# Install a data portal

https://earthcubeprojects-chords.github.io/chords-docs/gettingstarted/os/#tabs-W10

We would also like to encourage all users to make their data open by allowing for the NCAR MQTT subscriber to connect to your data set.

# Contribute a community node

Citizen scientist, researchers, educators, and students are encouraged to contribute new community nodes. For example, a hydrologist maybe interested in an enhanced HydroNode to connect soil moisture sensors, spectral sensors, streamflow gauges, and cameras to conduct long term analysis on a watershed or river basin. Furthermore, enhanced ComputeNode can be customized to accommodate RaspberryPis, user designed Single Board computers, Jetsons or other processors to conduct edge computing and image analysis on data from the station.
