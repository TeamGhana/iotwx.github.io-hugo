Have you wondered how the TV meteorologist come up with weather forecasts? Well, it all starts from making observations and collecting scientific data to records such as temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and direction. In this activity series, your class will build a 3D printed weather station. Each Node or module of the weather station can be built and operated independently allowing for teachers to customize their teaching plan. Fueled by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), automatic weather stations are everywhere, and are integrated into our daily activities, whether we know it or not. These stations have fueled citizen science observation networks and DIY weather stations that have come into prominence around the world.  With 3D-printed technology, low-cost microcontrollers and high precision digital sensors, supported by open software and hardware, a new era for continuous, advanced, automated weather observation is underway. Teachers and students can now take part in the IoT revolution by building a 3D Printed weather station.

# Teaching Modules
1.	AirNode: build a radiation shield (LINK)
2.	WindNode: build a 3D-printed Anemometer and Radiation Shield (LINK)
3.	HydroNode: Build a Rain Gauge (LINK)
4.	CommunityNodes(LINK)
5.	PVC stand and Power


## Student Learning Objectives
* Students will build a working weather station to collect measurements of temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and rain.
* Students will be able to list at least 3 types of variables weather stations collect.
* Students will be able to track changes in the weather, learn about the concept of a diurnal cycle, impacts of storm fronts, and seasons.
* Students will be able to understand concept of a computer model and microcomputer.

## Grade Level

This series is best-suited for use by high school students (10-12). With the software pre-installed and 3D-printed kits ordered (LINK), it can also be used with middle school students (7-9) as an introduction to a unit on electronics, weather observation, or as introduction to computer and data science.

## Time Required for Each Module

Preparation time: 1hr 
Classroom time: 50min assembly, optional 10 minute follow-up activities at teacher discretion


## Lesson Format

This lesson includes hands on assembly of 3d printed parts and interaction with a micro-computer. While advance activities may include 3d-printing the station at your school and diving into configuring the micro-computer, we have made available the option of pre-ordering the 3d-printed parts and downloading software needed.
* hands-on activity including assembly of 3D-printed parts from kit [order here].
* Optional hands-on activity using 3D-printers – files available [here]
* computer-based activity
* Graphing and reporting results
* Computation Thinking Raffle: ‘guess the temp’ or ‘compare with Local news weather’

# Education Standards Addressed
HS-ESS2-2 Earth's Systems of the Next Generation Science Standards and computer science standards are addressed in these activities. 

For NGSS, one must include all three dimensions: at least one of the practices, crosscutting concepts, and Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI)

The practices are:

1.	asking questions (for science) and defining problems (for engineering)
2.	planning and carrying out investigations
3.	analyzing and interpreting data
4.	using mathematics and computational thinking
5.	constructing explanations (for science) and designing or implementing solutions (for engineering)
6.	engaging in argument from evidence
7.	obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information

The crosscutting concepts include:
* Patterns. Observed patterns of forms and events guide organization and classification, and they prompt questions about relationships and the factors that influence them. 
* Systems and system models. Defining the system under study—specifying its boundaries and making explicit a model of that system—provides tools for understanding and testing ideas that are applicable throughout science and engineering.

Computer Science Standards include:
* Students will be able to explain how abstractions hide the underlying implementation details of computing systems embedded in everyday objects or devices.
* Students will be able to create interactive data visualizations using software tools to help others better understand real-world phenomena.
* Students will be able to categorize the role of operating systems, computational models, and APIs.
