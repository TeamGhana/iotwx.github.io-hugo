# $10 COMPUTE NODE
_Goal:_ Create sensor "blocks" driven by a single pi unit per block turning the architecture towards and IOT orientation.

* PiZero single core
	* $5
* 16GB MicroSD
	* $5

# $30 NODE-CENTRIC POWER PLANT 1
_Goal:_ Lower the cost and distribute the power across simple, off-the-shelf USB solar chargers and batteries.  In this configuration, USB panels connect to and charge high Ah batteries (available everywhere).  Coupled with a $10 compute node, power and compute can be had for under $50 (including cables).

* 10W mini portable solar panel
	* [$18 Lixada solar panels](https://www.amazon.com/Lixada-Effiency-Activities-Lighting-Monocrystalline/dp/B01MCXZJ8Y)
