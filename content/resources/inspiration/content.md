## 3D-Printed Stations
* [3D-PAWS original project](https://www.iepas.ucar.edu/core-programs/3dpaws/) and [design](https://sites.google.com/ucar.edu/3dpaws/) by Martin Steinson and Paul Kucera [UCAR/COMET](https://www.comet.ucar.edu).  The station is non-commercial, Raspberry-pi based and also >80% 3D-printed.
* LTB Weather station by [Rob W. Lakes on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2849562/files).

## Raspberry Pi-based Weather Stations
* [SkyWeather](https://www.switchdoc.com/products/skyweather-raspberry=pi-based-weather-station-kit-for-the-cloud) is a low-cost, commercial Raspberry Pi weather station kit for the cloud based on the [SwitchDoc PiWeather board](https://shop.switchdoc.com/products/piweather-interface-board-for-raspberry-pi-arduino-weather-stations) and [Blynk.io](https://blynk.io).
  Much of is NOT 3D printed, but there are a few  3D printed parts.  
* [RasperryWeather.com](https://www.raspberryweather.com/) is a nice resource for Pi-based weather stations.
